## The Problem It Solves

Most homeowners struggle with lawn care because:
1. **Timing is everything** — and most people don't know when soil is actually ready for fertilizer, seeding, or pre-emergent
2. **Generic advice doesn't fit their zone or grass** — a tip from a YouTube video may be wrong for your region and grass type
3. **No memory** — they can't remember when they last fertilized, what product they used, or how much they applied
4. **Equipment gets neglected** — oil changes and blade sharpenings are forgotten until something breaks

Lawn Care Tracker solves all four.

|---|---|
| Confident, grounded, practical | Hype-y, salesy, exaggerated |
| Specific numbers ("110+ publications") | Vague claims ("tons of research") |
| Plain English ("when the soil is ready") | Jargon-heavy without context |
| Empowering ("you'll finally know") | Condescending ("even beginners can…") |
| Relatable lawn care problems | Abstract or overly technical |

**Voice in one sentence:** Like a trusted neighbor who happens to have a horticulture degree.
